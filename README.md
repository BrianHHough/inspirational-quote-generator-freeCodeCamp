# ✨ Inspirational Quote Generator ✨

In this epic build, we're going to create a completely serverless quote generator using AWS as our cloud back-end and NextJS/TypeScript as our front-end.

The most epic part is...we're going to be generating images in a server without any expensive software or hardware. 
 
What you'll learn in this build is how to:

 👨‍💻 Build a ~cool~ front-end for a quote generator

 💡 Write a script to fetch a random inspirational quote from ZenQuotes' API 

 🌩 Use AWS to generate a quote graphic for you in the cloud & then let you download the file

 🔥 Deploy live


This build combines ZenQuotes' amazing API for fetching quotes, AWS Amplify for framework deployment and hosting, NextJS and Typescript for our front-end, styled-components to handle our styling,  and some spicy backend scripting 🌶


# Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** Without the AWS backend configured, you will probably see an error like this if you try to run the app as-is: `Module not found: Can't resolve '../src/aws-exports'` Please check out the [full tutorial on freeCodeCamp here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRmCxj9K7II) or scroll to the below section titled: "Instructions for Building the Project from Scratch" to get started building the project.

First, install the project dependencies from the root of the project:
```bash
npm i
# or
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Instructions for Building the Project from Scratch
The front-end development, which includes components, pages, framework setup, and styles, can be replicated with the code in this codebase.

The back-end development and deployment to AWS is intended to be built from scratch following the steps. It is imperative to build the project from start to finish so that you do not miss any of the requisite configuration steps.

# Instructions for Deploying to AWS (Hosting)
To add hosting to your project, you will want to run `amplify add hosting` and then follow the instructions including:
- Amplify Managed Hosting (not S3/CloudFront)
- Git-Based deployments with CI/CD
- Creating a `prod` branch of your code in GitHub and hooking that into the Amplify CI/CD pipeline.

The Lambda script requires a special method for 1.) running in the cloud; and 2.) being built for public deployment on a website.

Because of this, we will need to make a specific update to the Lambda script's `package.json` file so that it compiles correctly.

Next, we will need to edit the `amplify.yml` file to change the build settings of the project in the AWS Amplify Build Settings console:

## **PART 1:** Lambda Script Update:

### BEFORE UPDATE:
```json
{
  "name": "inspirationalquotelambda",
  "author": "Tech Stack Playbook™️ ",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "Lambda function generated by Amplify",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/aws-lambda": "^8.10.92"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^18.13.0",
    "node-fetch": "^2.6.9",
    "path": "^0.12.7",
    "sharp": "^0.31.3"
  }
}

```

### ✅ AFTER UPDATE:
```json
{
  "name": "inspoquotelambda",
  "author": "Tech Stack Playbook™️ ",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "Lambda function generated by Amplify",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "install:sharp": "npm i --arch=x64 --platform=linux sharp"
  },
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/aws-lambda": "^8.10.92"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20.1.0",
    "node-fetch": "^2.6.8",
    "path": "^0.12.7",
    "sharp": "^0.32.1"
  }
}
```

## **PART 2:** `amplify.yml` AWS Amplify Build Settings Update:
To find this page, go to the AWS Amplify app for your project in the AWS Management Console, then go to `App settings`, and then `Build settings`. On this page, you will see an editor with a title `App build specification`, to which you will edit the file with the following:

### BEFORE UPDATE:
```yml
version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - '# Execute Amplify CLI with the helper script'
        - amplifyPush --simple
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

### ✅ AFTER UPDATE:
```yml
version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run install:sharp --prefix ./amplify/backend/function/inspoquoteLambda/src
        - '# Execute Amplify CLI with the helper script'
        - amplifyPush --simple
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```
